Crop Disease Detection

Created a convolutional neural network to detect banana anthracnose and distinguish them from healthy bananas. Took images from Abhay farms in Bangalore but was unable to get much training data after the COVID-19 restrictions. Took many banana image samples from the following source: https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset/tree/master/Training/Banana
